# AskMyPDF – PDF-Powered Retrieval-Augmented Chatbot

**PDF-RAG** is a full-stack application that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them through an intelligent chatbot powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. The system leverages vector embeddings, semantic search, and LLMs to provide contextual answers grounded in uploaded documents.

## 🏗️ System Design

### 1. Authentication
- Managed by **Clerk**.
- Sign-in / sign-up screens with branding.

### 2. Home Page Layout
- **Left Panel**: PDF upload interface.
- **Right Panel**: Chatbot interface for document queries.

### 3. Workflow

#### 📥 Injection Phase
1. User uploads a PDF.
2. File path pushed into **BullMQ** queue.
3. Worker process:
   - Parse and chunk the PDF.
   - Generate embeddings for each chunk with **LangChain + OpenAI**.
   - Store embeddings in **Qdrant** vector database.

#### 🔍 Retrieval Phase
1. User enters a query in chat.
2. Query is converted to vector embeddings.
3. Retrieve relevant document chunks from **Qdrant**.
4. Provide query + retrieved context to the LLM.
5. Chatbot responds with context-grounded answer.
